# Medical RAG System for Rural Healthcare in India

A specialized Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed to provide malaria symptom checking and medical guidance for rural communities in India. Built with safety-first principles and comprehensive medical knowledge integration.

## 🏥 Project Overview

This system addresses the critical need for accessible medical information in rural Indian villages where healthcare resources are limited. It focuses specifically on malaria detection and provides culturally appropriate, multi-language support with emergency escalation protocols.

### Key Features

- **🔍 Intelligent Symptom Analysis**: Advanced NLP processing of symptoms in English and Hindi
- **⚡ Emergency Detection**: Real-time identification of critical symptoms requiring immediate care
- **📚 Comprehensive Knowledge Base**: Integration with authoritative medical sources (MedlinePlus, WHO, CDC, ICMR)
- **🛡️ Safety-First Design**: Built-in medical disclaimers and confidence scoring
- **🌐 Cultural Context**: Optimized for rural Indian healthcare patterns and terminology
- **🚀 Fast Response**: Sub-3 second response times for symptom queries

## 📋 Usage Examples

### Basic Symptom Check

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/check-symptoms \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"symptoms": "fever and chills for 3 days", "language": "en"}'
```

Response:
```json
{
  "assessment": "possible_malaria",
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "recommendations": [
    "Visit healthcare center for malaria testing within 24 hours",
    "Monitor symptoms closely",
    "Avoid self-medication"
  ],
  "emergency_alert": false,
  "disclaimer": "This information is for educational purposes only...",
  "sources": ["MedlinePlus", "WHO Malaria Guidelines"]
}
```

### Emergency Situation

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/check-symptoms \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"symptoms": "unconscious with high fever", "language": "en"}'
```

Response:
```json
{
  "assessment": "medical_emergency",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "emergency_alert": true,
  "immediate_action": "🚨 SEEK IMMEDIATE MEDICAL ATTENTION - Go to nearest hospital",
  "disclaimer": "EMERGENCY: These symptoms may indicate a serious condition...",
  "sources": ["Emergency Medical Protocols"]
}
```

### Hindi Language Support

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/check-symptoms \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"symptoms": "बुखार और सिर दर्द", "language": "hi"}'
```
